# Deployment Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your app was failing because it was trying to use SQLite tables that don't exist. The error occurred when Durable Objects tried to query database tables.

## The Solution
Since you don't want to store user information or email data, we've removed the database dependency entirely.

## What We Fixed

### 1. Removed Database Dependencies
- Removed D1 database binding from `wrangler.jsonc`
- Removed SQLite migrations from `wrangler.jsonc`
- Disabled database operations in Durable Objects

### 2. Current Architecture
Your app now works with:
- **Direct Gmail API connection** (no data storage)
- **Durable Objects for session management** (temporary storage only)
- **OAuth authentication** with Google
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time features

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create D1 Database (if you want to keep some features)
```bash
# Create a D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create pitext-mail-db

# This will give you a database ID, update it in wrangler.jsonc
```

### 2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```bash
# Deploy the worker
npx wrangler deploy

# Or deploy with tail logs
npx wrangler deploy --tail
```

### 3. Test the Deployment
```bash
# Check the deployment
curl https://pitext-mail.prabhatravib.workers.dev/health

# View logs
npx wrangler tail --format pretty
```

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in your Cloudflare Workers dashboard:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
OPENAI_MINI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
THREAD_SYNC_LOOP=true
```

## Expected Behavior

After deployment:
1. **Authentication works** - Users can sign in with Google
2. **Gmail connection works** - App connects directly to Gmail API
3. **No database errors** - No SQLite table queries
4. **Real-time features work** - WebSocket connections for live updates

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get database errors:
1. Check that SQLite migrations are removed from `wrangler.jsonc`
2. Ensure Durable Objects don't try to query non-existent tables
3. Verify the app uses direct Gmail API calls

### If authentication fails:
1. Check Google OAuth credentials
2. Verify redirect URIs are correct
3. Ensure environment variables are set

### If WebSocket connections fail:
1. Check Durable Object bindings in `wrangler.jsonc`
2. Verify the worker is deployed correctly
3. Check browser console for connection errors

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** using the steps above
2. **Test the authentication flow**
3. **Verify Gmail connection works**
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues

The app should now work without any database storage, connecting directly to Gmail API for all email operations.
