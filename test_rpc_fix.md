# RPC Token Serialization Fix - Test Plan

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Normal OAuth Flow**
- [ ] User signs in with Google
- [ ] Tokens are properly serialized through RPC
- [ ] Connection is created successfully
- [ ] No "Access token is required" error

### 2. **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Empty tokens (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Undefined tokens (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Null tokens (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Very long tokens (should handle properly)

### 3. **Fallback Mechanism**
- [ ] Primary RPC call fails
- [ ] Fallback mechanism triggers
- [ ] Connection still created successfully

### 4. **Debugging Verification**
- [ ] Logs show token lengths
- [ ] Logs show token types
- [ ] Logs show successful serialization
- [ ] No undefined token errors

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Error: Access token is required for connection creation
❌ Token debugging: { accessTokenType: 'undefined', accessTokenIsUndefined: true }
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Token validation passed: { accessTokenLength: 253, refreshTokenLength: 103 }
✅ Connection created successfully: d065f412-8091-43af-b4bf-852a520d992a
✅ RPC serialization test: { originalAccessTokenLength: 253, deserializedAccessTokenLength: 253 }
```

## Monitoring Points

1. **auth.ts logs**: Should show tokens being passed correctly
2. **ZeroDB logs**: Should show tokens received correctly
3. **Database**: Should show connection with proper tokens
4. **No errors**: Should not see "Access token is required" errors
