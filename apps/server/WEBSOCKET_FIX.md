# WebSocket Fix Summary

## Problem
WebSocket connections were failing with "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" because of two issues in the WebSocket upgrade process.

## Root Causes

### 1. Awaiting Durable Object Fetch ❌
**Issue**: The Hono route was awaiting the Durable Object's fetch call, which unwrapped the response and lost the special `webSocket` property.

**Fix**: Return the promise directly without awaiting.

**Before**:
```typescript
const response = await agent.fetch(c.req.raw);
return response;
```

**After**:
```typescript
return agent.fetch(c.req.raw);
```

### 2. Overly Strict WebSocket Upgrade Logic ❌
**Issue**: The ZeroAgent was manually checking Connection headers and setting Upgrade/Connection headers, which interfered with Cloudflare's automatic WebSocket handling.

**Fix**: Simplified the upgrade logic and let Cloudflare handle the headers automatically.

**Before**:
```typescript
const upgradeHeader = request.headers.get('Upgrade');
const connectionHeader = request.headers.get('Connection');

if (upgradeHeader?.toLowerCase() === 'websocket') {
  if (!connectionHeader?.toLowerCase().includes('upgrade')) {
    return new Response('Invalid WebSocket upgrade request', { status: 400 });
  }
  
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 101,
    webSocket: client,
    headers: {
      'Upgrade': 'websocket',
      'Connection': 'Upgrade',
    }
  });
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (request.headers.get('Upgrade')?.toLowerCase() === 'websocket') {
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 101,
    webSocket: client
  });
}
```

## Files Modified

### ✅ `apps/server/src/routes/index.ts`
- WebSocket route now returns promise directly without awaiting

### ✅ `apps/server/src/routes/agent/index.ts`
- Simplified WebSocket upgrade logic
- Removed manual header setting
- Removed strict Connection header validation

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Preserves WebSocket Property**: By not awaiting the fetch call, the special `webSocket` property on the Response object is preserved and passed through to Cloudflare.

2. **Lets Cloudflare Handle Headers**: Cloudflare Workers runtime automatically handles the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers during WebSocket handshakes. Manual header setting can interfere with this process.

3. **Simplified Validation**: The strict Connection header validation was unnecessary and could reject valid upgrade requests.

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ WebSocket connections should establish successfully
- ✅ No more "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" errors
- ✅ Real-time communication should work properly

## Testing

1. Deploy the changes
2. Open the application
3. Check browser console for WebSocket connection success
4. Verify real-time features are working

The WebSocket connection should now establish properly without being immediately closed.
