# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. tRPC Router Loading ✅
**Problem**: `@hono/trpc-server` doesn't support async functions for router property
**Error**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_config')"
**Fix**: Eagerly load router before passing to trpcServer

### 2. Hono Context Access ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect context variable access
**Fix**: Use `c.var.sessionUser` instead of `c.get('sessionUser')`

### 3. WebSocket Upgrade Logic ✅
**Problem**: Overly strict WebSocket upgrade logic interfering with Cloudflare
**Fix**: Simplified upgrade logic, removed manual header setting

### 4. WebSocket Routing ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect Durable Object ID mapping
**Fix**: Use connection ID for Durable Object creation when agentId is 'zero-agent'

### 5. Intercom JWT ✅
**Problem**: Using wrong secret and missing user_id claim
**Fix**: Use INTERCOM_WORKSPACE_SECRET and include user_id in payload

## Files Modified

### ✅ `apps/server/src/routes/trpc.ts`
- Fixed router loading to eagerly resolve before passing to trpcServer
- Fixed context access to use `c.var.sessionUser`

### ✅ `apps/server/src/routes/agent/index.ts`
- Simplified WebSocket upgrade logic
- Removed manual header setting
- Removed strict Connection header validation

### ✅ `apps/server/src/routes/index.ts`
- Fixed WebSocket routing to use correct Durable Object ID
- Returns promise directly without awaiting for WebSocket upgrades

### ✅ `apps/server/src/trpc/routes/user.ts`
- Fixed Intercom JWT to use INTERCOM_WORKSPACE_SECRET
- Added user_id claim to JWT payload
- Added fallback for missing environment variable

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
# Required for JWT authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# Required for Intercom integration
INTERCOM_WORKSPACE_SECRET=your_intercom_workspace_secret_here
INTERCOM_APP_ID=your_intercom_app_id_here

# Required for Durable Objects
ZERO_AGENT=your_durable_object_binding_name
ZERO_DB=your_durable_object_binding_name
ZERO_DRIVER=your_durable_object_binding_name
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

### ✅ tRPC Endpoints
- No more 500 errors
- Proper JSON error responses
- Authentication working correctly

### ✅ WebSocket Connections
- WebSocket connections establish successfully
- No more "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" errors
- Real-time communication working

### ✅ Intercom Integration
- No more 400 errors from Intercom API
- JWT authentication working correctly
- Intercom messenger loading properly

## Testing Steps

1. **Deploy the changes**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/server
   wrangler deploy
   ```

2. **Test tRPC endpoints**:
   ```bash
   node test-fix.js
   ```

3. **Check WebSocket connection**:
   - Open browser console
   - Look for successful WebSocket connection
   - No "WebSocket is closed" errors

4. **Check Intercom**:
   - Look for successful Intercom API calls
   - No JWT errors in console

## Troubleshooting

### If WebSocket still fails:
1. Check that the route is correctly deployed
2. Verify Durable Object bindings are correct
3. Check Cloudflare Worker logs for errors

### If Intercom still fails:
1. Verify INTERCOM_WORKSPACE_SECRET is set correctly
2. Check that the JWT payload includes user_id
3. Verify INTERCOM_APP_ID is set

### If tRPC still fails:
1. Check that all environment variables are set
2. Verify the router is loading correctly
3. Check authentication flow is working
