# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Register the PartyServer router first
**File:** `apps/server/src/routes/index.ts`

- Added `import party from 'hono-party';`
- Added `app.route("/agents", party);` at the top of route registration
- Removed manual WebSocket route handler since hono-party handles it automatically

### 2. ✅ Ensure the Durable-Object binding exists
**File:** `apps/server/wrangler.jsonc`

- Verified that `ZERO_AGENT` binding is correctly configured:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "ZERO_AGENT",
    "class_name": "ZeroAgent"
  }
  ```

### 3. ✅ Allow WebSocket connections in CSP
**File:** `apps/mail/vite.config.ts`

- Added Content Security Policy that allows WebSocket connections:
  ```typescript
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https: wss:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:;"
  ```

## What This Fixes

### Before the Fix:
- WebSocket connections were failing with 500 errors
- Durable Objects couldn't be reached via `/agents/*` routes
- CSP was blocking WebSocket connections (`wss:`)

### After the Fix:
- ✅ PartyServer router handles `/agents/*` routes automatically
- ✅ Durable Objects are properly bound and accessible
- ✅ CSP allows WebSocket connections (`wss:` protocol)
- ✅ WebSocket handshakes should complete successfully

## Expected Behavior

After deployment:
1. **WebSocket connections work** - No more "WebSocket connection failed" errors
2. **Durable Objects accessible** - `/agents/zero-agent/*` routes work
3. **Real-time features enabled** - Live email updates via WebSocket
4. **No CSP violations** - WebSocket connections allowed

## Deployment

Deploy the changes:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Test the WebSocket connection:
```bash
# Check if the worker is responding
curl https://pitext-mail.prabhatravib.workers.dev/health

# Monitor logs for WebSocket activity
npx wrangler tail --format pretty
```

## Verification

1. **Check WebSocket connection** in browser console
2. **Verify Durable Object binding** at `/debug/test-websocket`
3. **Test real-time features** like live email updates
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining connection issues

The WebSocket connection should now work properly without the previous 500 errors.
